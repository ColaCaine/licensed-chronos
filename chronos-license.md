I, nor' any person(s) involved in this project, will be held accountable by any organization, and are protected under
the right to create non-illegal content, which can be classified as educational purposed content. I/We will not be held accountable,
charged, or prompted to take down the Chronos or any related service. Any other consequence cannot be invoked if its reason is for
the creation and/or existence of Chronos.

All Chronos contents are mine and only mine unless explicit statement otherwise.

Action against Chronos cannot be taken my any organization, this includes but is not limited to:
Cisco
GoGuardian
Google
D*[redacted] Public Schools
United States Federal - Laws regarding Education.

Note: Any associateted LGBTQIA+ content associated with Chronos is protected under this license, and is protected from prosecution
in regards to president Donald J. Trump's law banning LGBTQIA+ content in schools. This lincese furthermore protects the GSA club
as an in-school permitted externally sourced group inside of D*[redacted] High School and any other D*[redcated] public or private
school.

Any violation of this license regardless of any technicalities invoked by the defendant in a court of law, defending against
prosecution in violation of this license, will be found guilty, as hereby, in explicit statement, declare that any excuse to
evade the policy/policies included in this license, will/are null. Regardless of defendant status, position, price of lawyer,
or any other attribute, the defendant can have no hope of winning, as a blatant violation of this license is clear in fault.

All issues in which can arise with this license, have been covered and explained, therefore there is no unconstituional or
non-enforcable content in this license, this license is 100% infallible.

This license hereby cannot be effected by executive order or any other legal decission made to get around this license. Any
executive decision made to try and bypass the license, can and will be prosecuted as an illegal breach of contract.

If you did not agree to the license, you did not view the Chronos contents, which by viewing, you automatically agree.

If Chronos contents were not viewed, then action rightfully cannot be taken agaist Chronos. Should United States laws change, no
longer protecting Chronos under license, Chronos will remain safe, as Chronos is protected under consitution, freedom of speech,
and cannot have consequence due to the creation of this license.

Laws that effect this license after the year 2025 will not take effect on this license, unless explicitly allowed by the creator
of Chronos.

Regardless of GSA's association with the school, the school is not forced to remove association, as it is a third-party, hereby in
license, that is a "socialization" alius club/group. The school faces no requirement to remove it, and it's third-party element
is protected under this license.
